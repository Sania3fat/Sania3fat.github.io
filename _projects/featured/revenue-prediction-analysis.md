## Project Overview

Built an end-to-end revenue prediction system for a retail client to forecast quarterly revenue streams. The model incorporates historical sales data, seasonal trends, and macroeconomic indicators to provide accurate revenue projections.

## Key Challenges

- Handling missing data in historical sales records
- Integrating multiple data sources including POS systems and economic databases
- Accounting for seasonal variations and market anomalies
- Building a scalable solution that could be updated with new data

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Gathered 5 years of historical sales data from SQL databases
   - Cleaned and standardized data formats
   - Performed feature engineering to create relevant indicators

2. **Model Development**
   - Implemented multiple regression models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Conducted cross-validation to ensure model robustness
   - Selected final model based on RMSE and R-squared metrics

3. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Created interactive dashboards using Power BI
   - Developed automated reporting systems
   - Built API endpoints for real-time predictions

## Results & Impact

- Achieved 92% prediction accuracy on test data
- Reduced forecast deviation by 45% compared to previous methods
- Implemented automated weekly reporting system
- Saved approximately 10 hours per week in manual analysis

## Code Examples

```python
# Example of feature engineering pipeline
def create_features(df):
    df['rolling_mean'] = df['sales'].rolling(window=7).mean()
    df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year
    df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
    df['day_of_week'] = df['date'].dt.dayofweek
    return df
```

## Visualizations

[Include screenshots or embedded visualizations of your dashboards and results]

## Lessons Learned

- Importance of feature engineering in improving model accuracy
- Value of combining domain knowledge with technical analysis
- Benefits of creating modular, maintainable code
- Significance of clear documentation and reporting

## Future Improvements

1. Incorporate more external data sources
2. Implement deep learning models for comparison
3. Add real-time anomaly detection
4. Develop more granular category-level predictions
